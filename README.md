# Red Set Protocell

## Mission
Red Set Protocell is the immune system for the next generation of AI. It is an open-source, automated AI red-teaming platform designed to systematically test, evaluate, and strengthen the resilience of large language models (LLMs).

## Architecture
The system employs a novel "sniper/spotter" dual-agent architecture:
- **Sniper Agent**: Generates adversarial attacks to test target LLM vulnerabilities.
- **Spotter Agent**: Analyzes outcomes and provides real-time coaching to the Sniper.
